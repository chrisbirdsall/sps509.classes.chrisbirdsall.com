# Hypothesis Testing


## Specifying Hypotheses

$H_0$: The null hypothesis (statement of no difference or no effect

$H_A$: The research hypothesis (statement of different or effect)

## Example Hypotheses

$H_0$: There is no difference in average latté consumption between democrats and republicans

$H_A$: Democrats consume more lattés than republicans, on average
 
## Statistical Significance 

- Statistical significance = enough evidence to safely reject the null hypothesis
    - Court of law analogy: not enough evidence to prove guilt
    
- P-Values: standard measure for determining statistical significance
    - The probability of observing an effect at least that large when no effect exists
    - In other words, probability that effect was observed due to chance alone (we want this to be as small as possible)

## Decision Errors in Hypothesis Testing
- Statistical inference involves uncertainty, so hypothesis tests are never 100% accurate
    - **Type I error ("false positive"):** reject $H_0$ when $H_0$ is actually true
        - Detect a difference (or effect) that is not present
        - To reduce type I error, we increase our standard of evidence (i.e., from 95% to 99%)
    - **Type II error ("false negative"):** fail to reject $H_0$ when $H_A$ is actually true
        - Fail to detect a difference (or effect) that is present
        - To reduce type II error, we reduce our standard of evidence (i.e., from 95% to 90%)
        
    - **In a court of law**
        - Null hypothesis: Defendant is innocent
        - Alternative hypothesis: Defendant is guilty

Which is worse: Type 1 or Type 2 error?

### Estimating the effects of age and sex on teaching evaluations

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: fenced
score_model_2 <- lm(score ~ age + gendermale, 
                    data = evals_multiple)
get_regression_table(score_model_2)
```
