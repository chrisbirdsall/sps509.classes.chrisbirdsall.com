Github is extremely helpful for tracking down problems with your code and for managing collaboration, which we’ll do in some labs later in the semester.\nAs the labs progress, you are encouraged to explore beyond what the labs dictate; a willingness to experiment will make you a much better programmer. Before we get to that stage, however, you need to build some basic fluency in R. Today we begin with the fundamental building blocks of R and RStudio: the interface, reading in data, and basic commands."

This command must be run in the Console.\nBased on the help file, how many rows and how many columns does the datasaurus_dozen file have? What are the variables included in the data frame? Add your responses to your lab report.\nLet’s take a closer look at these datasets by making a frequency table of the dataset variable.

We’ll go through a brief explanation in this lab, but more details and context for these commands will come in the next couple of weeks. For now, buckle up!\n\nExercise 2\nPlot y vs. x for the dino dataset. Then, calculate the correlation coefficient between x and y for this dataset. (Er… excuse me?)\nDon’t worry. All the code you need to accomplish this is already in your lab for you. You’ll just need to include the code and some other information in your R Markdown file.\nStart with the datasaurus_dozen and pipe it into the filter function to filter for observations where dataset == \"dino\". Store the resulting filtered data frame as a new data frame called dino_data.\n\ndino_data &lt;- datasaurus_dozen %&gt;%\n\nfilter(dataset == \"dino\")\n\nThere is a lot going on here, so let’s go through each part:\nFirst, the pipe operator: %&gt;%, takes what comes before it and sends it as the first argument to what comes after it. So here, we’re saying filter the datasaurus_dozen data frame for observations where dataset == \"dino\".\nSecond, the assignment operator: &lt;-, assigns the name dino_data to the filtered data frame and stores it as an object in your environment (take a look at the environment pane in the top left corner).\nNext, we need to visualize these data (yes, plural). We will use the ggplot function for this. The first argument specifies the data you’re visualizing. Next we define the aesthetic mappings (more on this next week). In other words, the columns of the data that get mapped to certain aesthetic features of the plot, e.g. the x axis will represent the variable called x and the y axis will represent the variable called y. Then, we add another layer to this plot where we define which geometric shapes we want to use to represent each observation in the data. In this case we want these to be points, hence geom_point.\n\nggplot(data = dino_data, mapping = aes(x = x, y = y)) +\n\ngeom_point()\n\nIf this seems like a lot, it is. And you will learn about the philosophy of building data visualizations in detail next week. For now, just stick with it and follow along with the code . Again, I do not expect this to make much sense yet.\nFor the second part of this exercise, we need to calculate a summary statistic: the correlation coefficient. Correlation coefficients, often referred to as \\(r\\) in statistics, measure the linear association between two variables. You will see that some of the pairs of variables we plot do not have a linear relationship between them. This is exactly why we want to visualize first: visualize to assess the form of the relationship, and calculate \\(r\\) only if relevant. In this case, calculating a correlation coefficient really doesn’t make sense since the relationship between x and y is definitely not linear…. it’s shaped like a dinosaur!\nBut, for illustrative purposes, let’s calculate the correlation coefficient between x and y anyway.\n\n\nStart with dino_data and calculate a summary statistic that we will call r as the correlation between x and y.\n\ndino_data %&gt;%\n  summarize(r = cor(x, y))\n\n\n\nExercise 3\nPlot y vs. x for the star dataset. You can (and should) reuse code we introduced above, just replace the dataset name with the desired dataset. Then, calculate the correlation coefficient between x and y for this dataset. How does this value compare to the r of dino?\n\n\nExercise 4\nPlot y vs. x for the circle dataset. You can (and should) reuse code we introduced above, just replace the dataset name with the desired dataset. Then, calculate the correlation coefficient between x and y for this dataset. How does this value compare to the r of dino?\n\n\nExercise 5\nFinally, let’s plot all datasets at once. In order to do this we will make use of facetting.\n\nggplot(datasaurus_dozen, aes(x = x, y = y, color = dataset))+\n  geom_point()+\n  facet_wrap(~ dataset, ncol = 3) +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n\n\n\nFacet by the dataset variable, placing the plots in a 3 column grid, and don’t add a legend.\nAnd we can use the group_by function to generate all the summary correlation coefficients.\n\ndatasaurus_dozen %&gt;%\n  group_by(dataset) %&gt;%\n  summarize(r = cor(x, y)) %&gt;%\n  print(13)"

What can you say about how the continents compare to each other in terms of their plastic waste per capita? Write and run the code required to create the faected histogram plot in your RMarkdown file.\n\n\nNOTE: Moving forward, the plots and the output of the code are not displayed in the lab instructions, but, as previously stated, you can and should copy the code to your R Markdown file and view the results yourself.\nYou probably noticed that it’s difficult to glean much from the visualization because Trinidad and Tobago is such an outlier. Let’s remove it from the dataframe and take another look.\nFirst, create a new data frame called plastic_waste_no (no for no outliers) and use the filter function to only keep observations (rows) where entity, the variable for country, is NOT Trinidad and Tobago. Note that the operator != means “is not equal to”.\n\nplastic_waste_no &lt;- plastic_waste %&gt;%\n  filter(entity != \"Trinidad and Tobago\")\n\nCopy your histogram code from the beginning of exercise 1 and paste it into a new code block. Replace plastic_waste with plastic_waste_no and run the code again.\nWhat differences do you notice between this histogram and the first? From now on we’ll use plastic_waste_no to generate our visualizations, mindful that we’re omitting Trinidad and Tobago. If, at any point, you would like to see what the data look like with Trinidad and Tobago included, simply use plastic_waste instead of plastic_waste_no.\n\nDensity plots\nAnother way of visualizing numerical data is using density plots.\n\nggplot(data = plastic_waste_no, aes(x = plastic_waste_per_cap)) +\n  geom_density()\n\nAnd compare distributions across continents by coloring density curves by continent.\n\nggplot(data = plastic_waste_no, \n       mapping = aes(x = plastic_waste_per_cap, \n                     color = continent)) +\n  geom_density()\n\nThe resulting plot may be a little difficult to read, so let’s also fill the curves in with colors as well.\n\nggplot(data = plastic_waste_no, \n       mapping = aes(x = plastic_waste_per_cap, \n                     color = continent, \n                     fill = continent)) +\n  geom_density()\n\nThe overlapping colors make it difficult to tell what’s happening with the distributions in continents plotted first, and hence covered by continents plotted over them. We can change the transparency level of the fill color to help with this. The alpha argument takes values between 0 and 1 (e.g., 0.5): 0 is completely transparent and 1 is completely opaque. There is no way to tell what value will work best, so you just need to try a few.\n\nggplot(data = plastic_waste_no, \n       mapping = aes(x = plastic_waste_per_cap, \n                     color = continent, \n                     fill = continent)) +\n  geom_density(alpha = 0.7)\n\nThis still doesn’t look great…"

You’ll see TYPE YOUR ANSWER HERE in your RMarkdown file in places where you should write a response. And you’ll see code blocks with #Delete and enter your code where you should write your own code.\n\n\nCopying/pasting and writing code\nCopying and editing code from other answers or examples is a great way to both save time and learn. If you copy code over and something isn’t working, look carefully at the edits you made to see whether you missed something in the copying/pasting process. Also, be sure you’ve edited ALL the variable/object names appropriately so you’re accomplishing what the question is asking you to do. You should also make sure that you’re typing the variable and object names EXACTLY as they appear in the dataset or environment pane (spelling and case must match exactly).\n\n\nIf you’re stuck\nIf you get stuck, don’t panic! Before you ask for help, give yourself a few minutes to figure it out. Search ModernDive, look at your previous labs, and google your problem with “tidyverse”. Also, step away from your computer for a few minutes if you need a break. Finally (and this doesn’t have to be the last step), ask for help on Slack!"

Tidying data can be really tricky in some cases so we’re going to go through this together.\nLet’s look at the data again, but this time we’re going to use the tbl_vars() function from the dyplyr package to just give us a list of all the variables in the dataset.\n\ngapminder_wide %&gt;% \n  tbl_vars()\n\nSo, we see from the output above that each variable has a year at the end of its name (e.g., pop_1952). If we’re interested in analyzing these data, we know we don’t want to have multiple columns for each variable (e.g., a life expectancy column for each year). We want ONE life expectancy variable (column) with values recorded for each year for each country in the dataset. So, let’s use the pivot_longer() function from the dplyr package to make our data tidy:\n\ngapminder_tidy &lt;- gapminder_wide %&gt;% \n  pivot_longer(names_to = c(\".value\", \"year\"),\n               names_sep = \"_\",\n               names_transform = list(year = as.integer),\n              cols = c(-continent, -country))\n\nThis code looks a little bit different than the pivot_longer code we went over in the lecture.

This is a very useful way to get a sense of the distribution of your data.

Pick better value with `binwidth`.\n\n\n\n\n\nA few things to note here:\n\nThere is only one variable being mapped in aes(): the single numerical variable weeks. You don’t need to compute the y-aesthetic: R calculates it automatically.\nWe set the geometric object as geom_histogram()\nThe warning message encourages us to specify the number of bins on the histogram, as R chose 30 for us.\n\nWe can change the binwidth (and thus the number of bins), as well as the colors like so.\n\nggplot(data = nc, aes(x = weeks))+ \n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, color = \"white\", fill = \"steelblue\")\n\n\n\n\nNote that none of these arguments went inside the aesthetic mapping argument as they do not specifically represent mappings of variables.\n\nExercise 6\nInspect the histogram of the weeks variable.

Hint: think about what each case is in this data set. \n\n**B.** What appears to be roughly the average length of pregnancies in weeks?\n\n**C.** If we changed the binwidth to 100, how many bins would there be?

The y aesthetic is the numeric variable you want to include in the boxplot, and the x aesthetic is a grouping variable. For instance, below we set gender as the aesthetic mapping for x, and gained as the aesthetic mapping for y. This creates a boxplot of the weight gained for mothers that had male and female newborns. Note that the fill argument is not necessary, but sets a color for the boxplots.\n\nggplot(data = nc, aes(x = gender, y = gained)) +\n  geom_boxplot(fill = \"sienna\")\n\n\n\n\n\nFor review, these are the different parts of the boxplot: ’\n\nThe bottom of the “box” portion represents the 25th percentile (1st quartile)\nThe horizontal line in the “box” shows the median (50th percentile, 2nd quartile)\nThe top of the “box” represents the 75th percentile (3rd quartile)\nThe height of each “box”, i.e. the value of the 3rd quartile minus the value of the 1st quartile, is called the interquartile range (IQR). It is a measure of spread of the middle 50% of values. Longer boxes indicating more variability.\nThe “whiskers” extending out from the bottoms and tops of the boxes represent points less than the 25th percentile and greater than the 75th percentiles respectively. They extend out no more than 1.5 x IQR units away from either end of the boxes. The length of these whiskers show how the data outside the middle 50% of values vary. Longer whiskers indicate more variability.\nThe dots represent values falling outside the whiskers or outliers. The definition of an outlier is somewhat arbitrary and not absolute. In this case, they are defined by the length of the whiskers, which are no more than 1.5 x IQR units long.\n\n\n\nExercise 9\nMake a boxplot of the weight gained by moms, split by the maturity status of the mothers (mature). Include axis labels and a title on your plot. Is the median weight gain during pregnancy larger for younger or older moms?

If we’re interested in analyzing these data, we know we don’t want to have multiple columns for each variable (e.g., a life expectancy column for each year). We want ONE life expectancy variable (column) with values recorded for each year for each country in the dataset. So, let’s use the pivot_longer() function from the dplyr package to make our data tidy:\n\ngapminder_tidy <- gapminder_wide %>% \n  pivot_longer(names_to = c(\".value\", \"year\"),\n               names_sep = \"_\",\n               names_transform = list(year = as.integer),\n              cols = c(-continent, -country))\n\nThis code looks a little bit different than the pivot_longer code we went over in the lecture.

    "text": "Exercise 2\nSpoiler: It ain’t tidy! Tidying data can be really tricky in some cases so we’re going to go through this together.\nLet’s look at the data again, but this time we’re going to use the tbl_vars() function from the dyplyr package to just give us a list of all the variables in the dataset.\n\ngapminder_wide %&gt;% \n  tbl_vars()\n\nSo, we see from the output above that each variable has a year at the end of its name (e.g., pop_1952). If we’re interested in analyzing these data, we know we don’t want to have multiple columns for each variable (e.g., a life expectancy column for each year). We want ONE life expectancy variable (column) with values recorded for each year for each country in the dataset. So, let’s use the pivot_longer() function from the dplyr package to make our data tidy:\n\ngapminder_tidy &lt;- gapminder_wide %&gt;% \n  pivot_longer(names_to = c(\".value\", \"year\"),\n               names_sep = \"_\",\n               names_transform = list(year = as.integer),\n              cols = c(-continent, -country))\n\nThis code looks a little bit different than the pivot_longer code we went over in the lecture. For more information about all of these arguments visit the the pivot longer webpage for the tidyrpackage.\n\ngapminder_tidy %&gt;% \n  tbl_vars()"

You’ll also want to add a color=continent argument in your aes()."
